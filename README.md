# SSH Key
This is my SSH key script which will allow you to install and uninstall my SSH key from your system.  It is very quick and easy to use, all you have to do is run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HoloPanio/SSH-Key/main/hpdev-ssh.sh)
```
